# FAITH-Autosplitter v1.4 
### The Autosplitter is useable for FAITH Chapters I, II, & III
#### The original logic was written by KunoDemetries
##### Inside of the .asl file is the code for the Autosplitter. Use this file for the Scriptable Autosplitter in LiveSplit.
##### Will work on providing the splits aswell. I just need to double check everything first.
